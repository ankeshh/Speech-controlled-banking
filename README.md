## **I. Abstract**

In this project we propose an online banking system, which is user-friendly and secure. The main aspect of the project for us is to provide basic functionality of a bank in a secure manner, we propose using a Three-factor authentication system. Many online systems use two-factor authentication systems and there have beenmany cases and studies done where the two-factor systems were able to be bypassed, so we intended to add another level of security, so as to further secure our banking system and provide users with peace of mind when performing online transactions and while dealing with their personal accounts and information.

## **II. Introduction**

In the current state of the world, physically going to a bank outlet has become increasingly difficult as well as dangerous, this  has given rise to a large increase in online banking systems around the world. An Online banking system is a simple User Interface aiming to provide essential banking features, we aim to design a system that is simple and comprehensible to any customer. A user will be able to login as either an admin or customer, both having different privileges and permission within the system.
The main goal for us is to be able to perform crucial tasks such as money transfers and taking deposits, through online transactions, all of which will be done using a secure system. We are implementing a three-factor authentication system for all users.
